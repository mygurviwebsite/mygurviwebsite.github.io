    Art has been a passion of mine since childhood, but I discontinued pursuing it because it was not considered worthwhile compared to an engineering degree. In recent years, I started to explore the space of art again. Instead of focusing on the craft of traditional art forms like I did before, Iâ€™m more interested in modern and contemporary art ideas and trying out different mediums.
